    Fixed driver script args issue; correctly-inputted command line txt now is properly run through the script.  Contuning with 1d fixing.

    Simplified 1d code, working on coverting 2nd 1d for loop into sapply.  Also trying to find where my 1d fn apparently recalculates whether a person gets infected.

    Massive developments in syntax simplicity and semi-correct outputted values for 1e after email back.  Now troubleshooting pipj probability bug in 1d.

    Minor improvement, script is beginning to output something that roughly looks like the intended output.  However, it's exceeding the 500 person limit defined in the driver script after 4 iterations, though it is outputting only 21 total infected iteration items, which is good.

    Trying to find whatever bug is making things refuse to work still.  Commiting for development sake, though little has changed in the functionality of the code.  Continuing to troubleshoot

    Continueing with 1e.  In the middle of transforming the updated infection status matrix by combining it with the one that fn 1d sources to generate it.

    Deep into trying to properly combine the last updated_inf_stat_vec w/ the initial_inf_stat_vec using vectorization.  At the respective idecies where their values are not equal, I'm trying to get them to add together (ie. 1 +0) in order to produce a new updated_inf_stat_vec that retains the results of the previous run.

    Have begun constructing driver script.  Currently troubleshooting the correct way to iterate the 1e 'updated' infection-status vector following the initial call using the initial_inf_stat_vec (1a fn).  More comments have been added as progress continues.

    Part way through 1e; working on iterating xi_to_xj_interaction with the updated infection status vector it produces each time.  Currently finished simple first iteration it performs w/ the initial infection status vector.

    Further into 1d development now.  Trying to back track and see if there's a way to make things cleaner by implementing apply() to the filtered_prob_transmission vector.  Stil working on the functionality of the the initial inf status vector to make sure pi*pj is being calculated.  Added further commenting.

    Finished implemeenting items 3 of 1d; can now properly calculate the % chance of becoming infected via the xj interactions with individual xi.  Now in the middle of item 4 to properly sample if person xi actually becomes infected by any of the interactions with persons xj.
